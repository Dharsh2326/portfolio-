## CSS Styling Used

The portfolio uses **internal CSS** defined within a `<style>` tag in the HTML `<head>`. The CSS enhances the visual appeal while keeping the structure simple.

### Key CSS Selectors and Properties

| Selector | Purpose / Description |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `body`   | Sets font-family to Arial, background color to whitesmoke, text color to dark gray (`#333`), and applies padding and margin for spacing. |
| `h1`     | Centers the main title, uses serif font family (Cambria, Georgia, Times), color `#2c3e50`, and padding for spacing. |
| `nav`    | Centers navigation links, sets color to a light blue `#5bc0f6`, uses serif font, and applies lighter font weight. |
| `p`      | Sets comfortable font size (16px) and line-height (1.5) for readability. |
| `hr`     | Creates a thin horizontal line with a soft pink border (`#fdc3c3`) and margin spacing above and below. |
| `h2`     | Styles section headings with a darker gray color (`#444`). |
| `table`  | Uses full width, collapses borders, and adds margin for spacing between sections. |
| `td`     | Applies border, padding, center-aligns text, and uses oblique font style for a subtle effect. |
| `td ul`  | Left-aligns unordered lists inside table cells for better readability. |
| `ul li`  | Adds padding to list items for spacing. |
| `.box`   | A container class that centers content, limits max width to 1000px, applies white background, padding, rounded corners, and a light gray border to create a card-like layout. |
